# pavlokoval.dev

This is a source code of updated website (so called design v2)

Built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and pure CSS. [Radix Colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors/custom) tool was used to generate a color palette and a few [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/icons/) were used as well.

Main website fonts:

- Headings - [Space Grotesk](https://fontsource.org/fonts/space-grotesk)
- Main texts - [Inter](https://fontsource.org/fonts/inter)
- Code snippets - [JetBrains Mono](https://fontsource.org/fonts/jetbrains-mono)

To run project locally:

- Install dependencies `pnpm install`
- Run the project `pnpm run dev`
- (optionally) you can use a prettier to prettify the code `pnpm run prettier`
